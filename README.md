# quantum_scattering
Computation (using python and jupyter lab) for automating and animating of quantum particle incident on finite potential in one-dimension. 
Relays the transmission and reflection coefficients as well as the probablity of finding the quantum particle within 
the potential. 
Also displays the potential-space (or k-space) which indicates both the magnitude (energy) or the velocity and direction 
of the wave packet (or packets upon transmission and reflection). 


The theory behind the model is explained in the [attached pdf](https://github.com/josh-u-a/quantum_scattering/blob/master/QuantumScattering.pdf).
